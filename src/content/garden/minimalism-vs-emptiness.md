Minimalism isn't about emptinessâ€”it's about intentionality. Every element that remains has earned its place through purpose and meaning.

Empty spaces in design aren't voids to be filled, but breathing room that allows the important elements to speak more clearly. The space between notes is what gives music its rhythm.

True minimalism requires the courage to say no to good things in service of great things. It's not about having less for the sake of less, but about making room for what matters most.
