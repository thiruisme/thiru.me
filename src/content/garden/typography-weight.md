Typography carries emotional weight. A handwritten font whispers intimacy, while a sans-serif speaks with clarity. The choice of typeface is the choice of voice.

Every font has a personality, a mood, a cultural context. Comic Sans feels casual and approachable. Times New Roman feels formal and authoritative. The words might be the same, but the typography shapes how they're received.

Good typography is invisible until it's not. When it's wrong, it creates friction. When it's right, it becomes a transparent vessel for meaning.
