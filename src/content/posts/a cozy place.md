Ten years ago, minimalism was all the rage. It was the shiny new aesthetic that was finally here to take down those ghoulish Web 2.0 style aesthetics that were ubiquitous. Not only were flat and minimal websites easy to scale across devices, but they were also easy on system resources (which mobile phones back then really appreciated). I was one among the millions who cheered for it.

Now, in 2025, I crave the pre-minimalism designs again. They were unique, colorful, and interesting to look at. There’s no reason we can’t revive Web 2.0 aesthetics, especially now that people are growing tired of the flat trend (which, in my opinion, overstayed its welcome).

Yes, those designs had issues with accessibility and visual contrast, but modern techniques have largely addressed these problems. We can rewind to the time when the internet was something much simpler. No server-side scripts, no heavy JavaScript, no trackers, no desperate SEO optimizations—just pure HTML and CSS.

Creating this blog was a personal challenge for myself. I want to move away from the complex cacophony of the internet, with its overreliance on money-making being the primary motivator for any sort of content posted online. I want to carve out a cozy little space—a place to share my ideas freely, without obligations on either side.

Made using Astro, this blog does not have a complex backend like WordPress or Ghost. Astro takes my posts and generates static HTML files using a template I handcrafted. This helps the page load faster, even with extremely slow internet connections.

This site serves as a critique of the current state of the internet, a personal challenge to push myself, a learning opportunity, and an ode to Web 2.0 aesthetics, all at once.

It’s a gentle reminder that the web can still be personal, inviting, and uniquely human.
