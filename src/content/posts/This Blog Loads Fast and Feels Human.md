Slow, gradual shifts are a total mindf*ck.

I still remember **2015**. It feels just like a few years ago, but it’s been almost a decade.

It was in and around 2015 that I got a taste of the *minimalism* every designer was looking forward to back then—flat designs, vectors, minimal websites… those were the next shiny thing. We were all so fed up with the *old-school* design aesthetics that were prevalent at the time: shiny buttons, gradients, drop-shadows, and skeuomorphic elements (oh my God!). Not only were they a hacky mess most of the time, they didn’t scale for mobile phones and were relatively bad for usability as well, with poor contrast and unreadable text.

Fast-forward ten years to today. The change was slow and gradual, but when I look back now, so many things have changed.

We’ve now completely embraced the flat aesthetic to the point that it’s **sickening** to look at. The disingenuous thing is that this *simplicity* is only surface-level. These *flat* sites and designs give the illusion of simplicity while hiding so much unnecessary complexity behind them.

A simple personal blog **doesn’t need Google Analytics**. It doesn’t need to save cookies, show pop-ups, or load more JavaScript than what is absolutely necessary. But these things are used anyway—used to track us.

> And for what?

Even without all this mess, a clean and functional blog can easily load **under 100 KB** (excluding images). But most modern *minimal* sites still feel slow, bloated, and over-engineered.

> “Why?” you may ask.

The truth is, most of these *personal* blogs aren’t personal anymore. They’re SEO-optimized, auto-generated junk to the point that I don’t trust any WordPress site that pops up in my search results. The SEO game itself is absolutely disgusting. It’s not a creative expression anymore. It’s a rat race.

It doesn’t end there. The junkification of the internet continues in other places too—LinkedIn, YouTube comments, Twitter (sorry, I’m **not** calling it *X*), and most saddeningly, Medium. What was supposed to be a thoughtful place now looks and feels like a word processor filled with AI junk. The irony is that even the *clean* designs feel soulless. No passion. No individuality. Just templates that talk to bots.

At this point, I start associating minimal design with **generic nothingness**. I’m sick of it. I don’t want to utter the *M-word* again anytime soon.

## Building my own space

I wanted to make a point, no matter how small it is—so **I built my own blog**. From scratch. No pre-made templates. No platforms chasing SEO or scale. Just simple code and honest intention.

I’ve always been someone who curates everything around me. And when people say *“keep things simple,”* what they really mean these days is *“make it minimal.”* But minimal has become an excuse for laziness. What I wanted was **not less… but soul. Intent. Character.**

Everything you see here is something I chose deliberately: the green grid background, the fixed-width container, the weird logo GIF I made in After Effects, the typeface. Whether you like it or think it’s ugly, **it’s mine.**

## There must be a reason

> “But what about Web 2.0’s disadvantages?”

That’s the beauty of modern web standards. I used only **HTML** and **CSS** to build the site, with a very small sprinkle of **JavaScript**. Back then, to achieve a site like this, one might have had to hack the HTML table or use jQuery. But all those things are possible right here, cleanly, with just HTML5 and CSS3.

I’ve also ensured that text contrast for important things is proper. Let’s be honest—usability was the only real reason Web 2.0 style was considered *bad*. Once that’s fixed, it becomes so much better than whatever we are getting nowadays. I’ve ensured all the semantic tags are correct.

This page is so simple and properly structured that if you print it, it’ll wrap nicely on an A4 sheet. I bet that’s not the case with most other sites, full of unnecessary clutter layered on top.

> “Who even prints webpages nowadays?”

You’re right. But that’s just shorthand for saying the site is semantically correct. It means that someone who is visually impaired can listen to the page without being interrupted by useless overlays or accessibility-breaking noise.

And yes—just to reiterate—the entire HTML file (excluding images) is **under 100 KB**.

## An ode to Web 2.0

This is my ode to Web 2.0 sites—not nostalgia for nostalgia’s sake, but because the internet used to have a **soul**. And I want that back.

Thanks for visiting. **You’re welcome here.**
