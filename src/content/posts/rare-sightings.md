Some Pokémon only appear under very specific conditions:

- **Feebas** on Route 119 — fish tiles only (use Super Rod)  
- **Bagon** in Meteor Falls — 5% chance on floor 2  
- **Elekid** in Oldale Brewery — 10% chance post-Elite Four  
- **Larvitar** in Mt. Pyre — during night hours only  

Plan your trips carefully, and keep that Fishing Rod ready!
